# elm-sample-app

This is a simple sample app developed using [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) for a [presentation](http://prezi.com/qjtj4jkiv6kv/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy) I recently did during the [Hamburg Haskell Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Hamburg-Haskell-Meetup/events/221726017/), talking about FRP and Elm.

## Goals

The aim is to showcase the building blocks of Elm, the architecture of an Elm application, the interop with Javascript and in general to give an idea of modelling a problem using a functional reactive approach. It's not beautiful nor polished but that wasn't in scope.

## Related material

[The presentation](http://prezi.com/qjtj4jkiv6kv/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy) aims at giving a quick overview of Elm and its philosophy and hopefully stimulate curiosity. It is a ultra-condensed version of the following material:

- A [couple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Agu6jipKfYw) of [presentations](https://prezi.com/du7t77l6wffk/the-elm-architecture/) by Elm's BDFL Evan Czaplicki
- [Evan Czaplicki's thesis](http://elm-lang.org/papers/concurrent-frp.pdf)
- Documentation available [online]((http://elm-lang.org))

## Bonus material

During the presentation I mentioned [Brent Victor](http://worrydream.com/) as one of the inspirators for a lot of goodness added to the Elm ecosystem, make sure you at least see [this talk](http://worrydream.com/#!/InventingOnPrinciple) and read [this blog post](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/) if you want to know more about it (and get ready, it'll blown your mind).
